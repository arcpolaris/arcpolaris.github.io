	<h2>The Color Green</h2>
	<p>Green is the color between cyan and yellow on the visible spectrum. It is evoked by light which has a dominant
		wavelength of roughly 495â€“570 nm. In subtractive color systems, used in painting and color printing, it is
		created by a combination of yellow and cyan; in the RGB color model, used on television and computer screens, it
		is one of the additive primary colors, along with red and blue, which are mixed in different combinations to
		create all other colors. By far the largest contributor to green in nature is chlorophyll, the chemical by which
		plants photosynthesize and convert sunlight into chemical energy. Many creatures have adapted to their green
		environments by taking on a green hue themselves as camouflage. Several minerals have a green color, including
		the emerald, which is colored green by its chromium content.</p>
