	<h2>The Color Blue</h2>
	<p>Blue is one of the three primary colours in the RYB colour model (traditional colour theory), as well as in the
		RGB (additive) colour model. It lies between violet and cyan on the spectrum of visible light. The term blue
		generally describes colours perceived by humans observing light with a dominant wavelength between approximately
		450 and 495 nanometres. Most blues contain a slight mixture of other colours; azure contains some green, while
		ultramarine contains some violet. The clear daytime sky and the deep sea appear blue because of an optical
		effect known as Rayleigh scattering. An optical effect called the Tyndall effect explains blue eyes. Distant
		objects appear more blue because of another optical effect called aerial perspective.</p>
